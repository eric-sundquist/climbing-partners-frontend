## About

I completed this during a project course in the end of my first year of uni 2022. In the course we where given the freedom to develop a new application with a tech-stack of choice, from idea to finished project. It should be developed in an agile manner and I had sprint meetings each week together with a supervisor.

The "Climbing Partners" application is made to help climbers more efficiently find partners to climb with. You can create a profile where you log your experience as a climber. By putting up an ad when, where and how you want to climb, the application matches you with suitable climbers. Send a climb request and use the direct chat to communicate further. Confirmed upcoming climbs are saved and showed under "Upcoming climbing sessions".
