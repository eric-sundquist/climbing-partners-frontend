Repo for "Climbing partners" app front end. React with MaterialUI

The application was created during a project course during my first year in uni. It involved choosing a suitable project, defining requirments and adapting a agile development process. 

More information can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/eric-sundquist/climbing-partners-frontend/wiki). However the menu and many of the links broke when migrating from gitlab.
